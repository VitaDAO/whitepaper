# VitaDAO Whitepaper

## Reproduction of Working Copy

This is a reproduction of the whitepaper working copy google doc [available bere](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UKF59VRNxpbE1B9P5N-KQ3HvH_8CRseHHtZ6tljRSk/edit#).

The only changes to this file from the original are: 
- Minor spelling issues
- Table of contents has links to document sections
- APA style citations that are linked within the doc
- A title page with a VitaDAO graphic
- Some citations are corrected or modified to use original sourcee where that was possbile
  - When changed, new citations were vetted for fidelity to original point
  - Provided links to free full file downloads where I could find the (avoided pay per article aggregators)
  - Some citations changed names due to APA ordring rules (but made sure this didn't affect Scheibye-Knudsen)
  - Completely replaced Mullard's article summary with DiMasi's original work that was more up to date
    -Mullard's article summary remains in the .bib file, but doesn't appear in the PDF. 
- There are definitely some additional editing changes needed, but kept close to the original

## Comments from the Working Copy

There were several unaddressed open comments in the original Google docs working copy. Over the coming days, I will be turning all of those into Github issues and attempting to make the original commentor a reviewer for that issue. 

If you have any questions about how to contribute, the editing done to the document, of anything related to how to make this work better for you, please contact audieleon#9746 at the [VitaDAO discord](https://discord.gg/3S3ftnmZYD).
