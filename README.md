# VitaDAO Whitepaper

### Reproduction of Working Copy

This is a reproduction of the whitepaper working copy on Google docs [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12UKF59VRNxpbE1B9P5N-KQ3HvH_8CRseHHtZ6tljRSk/edit#).

The only changes to this file from the original are: 
- Minor spelling issues
- Table of contents now links to document sections
- APA style citations 
  - Citations link to reference page
- A title page with a VitaDAO graphic
- Some citations are corrected or modified to use original source where that was possible
  - When changed, I vetted new citations for fidelity to original point
  - Provided links to free full file downloads where I could find them (avoided pay per article aggregators)
  - Some citations changed names due to APA ordring rules (but I made sure this didn't affect Scheibye-Knudsen)
  - Completely replaced Mullard's article summary with DiMasi's original work that was more up to date. Mullard's article summary remains in the .bib file, but doesn't appear in the PDF. 
- There are definitely some additional editing changes needed, but I kept close to the original

### Comments from the Working Copy

There were several unaddressed open comments in the original Google docs working copy. Over the coming days, I will turn all of those into Github issues and attempt to make the original commentor a reviewer for that issue. 

If you have any questions about how to contribute, the editing done to the document, of anything related to how to make this work better for you, please contact `audieleon#9746` at the [VitaDAO discord](https://discord.gg/3S3ftnmZYD).
